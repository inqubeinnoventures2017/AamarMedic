<div class="divimg"><p><h4>WHAT IS COVID-19 ?</h4></p></div>
<p>
    Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered
    coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate
    respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
</p>

<div class="divimg"><p><h4>HOW IT SPREADS?</h4></p></div>
<p>Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or
    sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then
    touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.</p>

<div class="divimg"><p><h4>What can I do to protect myself?</h4></p></div>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with
        soap and water.
    </li>
    <li>
        Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or
        sneezing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek
        medical attention and call in advance.
    </li>
</ol>
</p>

<div class="divimg"><p><h4>Can this virus disease spread through air?</h4></p></div>
<p>Airborne spread has not been reported for COVID-19 and it is not believed to be a major driver of
    transmission based on available evidence.</p>

<div class="divimg"><p><h4>Is there a vaccine for the COVID-19?</h4></p></div>
<p>When a disease is new, there is no vaccine until one is developed. It can take a number of years
    for a new vaccine to be developed.</p>

<div class="divimg"><p><h4>Wash your hands frequently</h4></p></div>
<p>
    Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap
    and water.
</p>

<div class="divimg"><p><h4>Maintain social distancing</h4></p></div>
<p>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or
    sneezing.</p>

<div class="divimg"><p><h4>If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care
    early</h4></p></div>
<p>
    Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing,
    seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health
    authority.
</p>

<div class="divimg"><p><h4>What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of
    disease</h4></p></div>
<p>
    Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
    available on the national,state and local public health authority. Many
    countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several
    have seen outbreaks.
</p>

<div class="divimg"><p><h4>Should I worry about COVID-19?</h4></p></div>
<p>
    Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for
    children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness:
    about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is
    therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19
    outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.
</p>

<div class="divimg"><p><h4>Who is at risk of developing severe illness</h4></p></div>
<p>
    While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people,
    older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such
    as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or
    diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.
